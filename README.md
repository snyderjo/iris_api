# iris_api

This code estimates three machine learning models (and an ensemble thereof) from Fisher's iris data set, and packages the resulting algorithms into an API, exposing predictions as endpoints.

### To-Done:
Create a docker container which serves the same purpose as the initial API.
Currently works locally.  

### To-Do:  
Move it to a different cloud provider, and test it there.
maybe: Identify which python package is pulling ipython/jupyter upon `pip install -r requirements2.txt`
